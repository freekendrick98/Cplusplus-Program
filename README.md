#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is CTS (Creative Technology Solutions) and their objective is to make their game "Draw it or Lose it" accessible on multipe platforms.
The objective is  to help edit the code that your team has devceloped as well as create a design template.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Documentation is one of the easiest task when it comes to a project. Being a CS major I've honed myself to pay attetion to all of the small details.
While some of the documentation questions may have been impartial to my opinion, I base my decisions on what others have done before me while correcting their mistakes.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document makes the user look at every single aspect of the code in order to answer the questions. In doing this, the user is forced to look over the entirety of the code and familirize themselves with it and how it works.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change anything it would be the software selection aspect. While I did my research, there are always other options or methods that may or may not be more efficent. I recommended MacOS for any kind of editing, but I personally don't know or use that OS. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Considering the users needs is one of the most important aspects of the design. If the project doesn't do what the user wants then its pointless. All of the users needs were met in this project because it was done step by step as instructed in the rubrics.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached his with an open mind as it was my first time doing something like this. Reading everything three times and out loud is what I will take away from this expierence. Reading in your head, while efficent, allows the user to overlook errors. When you read everything out loud it allows you to hear how it sounds and to make quick changes.
